    "1. Jupyter Notebook is a browser-based tool for interactive explanatory text, mathematics, computations and coding. The main charactorics are cell and kernel. Cell is a component of your entire code to run separately. Kernel is the compiler you choose for your cells. There are different kernels working for varied programming languages. And Python 3 is the one you will use for CW2.\n",

    "2. Jupyter Notebook allows you to run your code from any cell, which asks run and save all previous cells. So, separate data loading and other process will save your time."
